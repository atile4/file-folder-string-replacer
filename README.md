# file-folder-string-replacer
Copies an inputted valid directory (and all of its contents) into a specified output directory, and replaces all occurrences in directory name, file name, and file contents of a target string with a replacement string.

Directory inputs should contain the full path.

LIMITATIONS:

For file contents, the program will only modify the file contents of .sql files unless the program is directly modified.
