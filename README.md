# file-folder-string-replacer
Copies an inputted valid directory (and all of its contents) into a specified output directory, and replaces all occurrences in directory name, file name, and file contents of a target string with a replacement string.

LIMITATIONS:

For file contents, the program will only modify the file contents of .sql files the program is directly modified.

The program will not work if directory names have quotation marks around them.
